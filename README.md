# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## 👋🏾 About Me

I'm Shahrouz Nikseresht (aka Sherouz), a 23-year-old aspiring backend developer from Tehran, Iran.
I focus on **Python, automation, Flask/Django, APIs, and backend fundamentals**, sharing projects, notes, and experiments as I learn and grow.
This GitHub documents my journey toward professional backend development through practical coding, project-based learning, and open documentation.

## 🌱 Current Focus

- Python scripting and automation for real-world tasks
- Backend fundamentals with Flask & Django
- API development and integration
- Databases, data structures, and algorithms

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [Retro Terminal Guess](https://github.com/Sherouz/retro-terminal-guess) — Command-line guessing game in Python, emphasizing loops, conditionals, and clean code practices
- More projects coming as I continue building and experimenting

## 🚀 My Approach

I focus on **learning by building practical projects**. Each project is designed to reinforce skills step by step, from exercises to functional applications.
I prioritize **clarity, reusability, and maintainability** in my code, documenting everything openly to track growth and help others follow along.

## 📖 My Journey So Far

![My GitHub Contributions](https://github-contributions-svg.deno.dev/api?username=Sherouz)

Every line of code I write is part of a bigger path.
I experiment, break things, rebuild them, and document everything I learn along the way.
From simple Python scripts to automation and backend APIs, this is my playground.
I don't have all the skills yet, but I'm building them, step by step.

This GitHub is my **learning canvas**. Each commit, project, or note is a small milestone on my path to becoming a professional backend developer.
I share openly so others can follow, replicate, or even challenge my approach.

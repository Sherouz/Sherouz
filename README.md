# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## 👋🏾 About Me

I'm Shahrouz Nikseresht, a 24-year-old aspiring backend developer from Tehran, Iran.
I focus on **Python, automation, Flask/Django, APIs, and backend fundamentals**, sharing projects, notes, and experiments as I learn and grow.
This GitHub documents my journey toward professional backend development through practical coding, project-based learning, and open documentation.

## 🌱 Current Focus

- Python scripting and automation for real-world tasks
- Backend fundamentals with Flask & Django
- API development and integration
- Databases, data structures, and algorithms

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [Retro Terminal Guess](https://github.com/Sherouz/retro-terminal-guess) — Command-line guessing game in Python, emphasizing loops, conditionals, and clean code practices.
- [Coffee Machine CLI](https://github.com/Sherouz/coffee-machine-cli) — Beginner Python CLI project simulating a coffee machine, focusing on OOP and command-line applications.
- [Tiny Hero](https://github.com/Sherouz/tiny-hero) — A turn-based combat system in Python, designed to master advanced OOP, modular architecture, and the Façade Pattern using the Rich CLI library.
- More projects coming as I continue building and experimenting

## 📦 Project Collections

Here are my **collection-style repositories**, each containing multiple small projects or tools, designed to be explored together and learned from step by step.

* [Real World Python Utilities](https://github.com/Sherouz/real-world-python-utilities)
  A collection of **practical Python tools** for automation, file organization, and simplifying daily workflows. Each tool is **lightweight, modular, and independent**, perfect for learning or personal productivity.
* [80 Days of Challenges](https://github.com/Sherouz/80-days-of-challenges)
  A personal Python challenge with **small exercises (5–50 lines)** over 80 days. Focuses on **logic, algorithms, and Python fundamentals**, with progress tracked and sharable on Twitter (`#80DaysOfChallenges`).

> Each collection is structured to let you explore **independent scripts or mini projects** step by step, emphasizing clarity, reusability, and learning through doing.

## 🚀 My Approach

I focus on **learning by building practical projects**. Each project is designed to reinforce skills step by step, from exercises to functional applications.
I prioritize **clarity, reusability, and maintainability** in my code, documenting everything openly to track growth and help others follow along.

## 📖 My Journey So Far

Every line of code I write is part of a bigger path.
I experiment, break things, rebuild them, and document everything I learn along the way.
From simple Python scripts to automation and backend APIs, this is my playground.
I don't have all the skills yet, but I'm building them, step by step.

This GitHub is my **learning canvas**. Each commit, project, or note is a small milestone on my path to becoming a professional backend developer.
I share openly so others can follow, replicate, or even challenge my approach.
